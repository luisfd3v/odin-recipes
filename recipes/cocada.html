    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cocada is a popular street food sold everywhere in Brazil.</p>
    <p>It's a sweet made with grated fresh coconut.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>1/2 can sugar (use sweetened condensed milk can as measure)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>3 cups grated fresh coconut</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Â½ teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Combine condensed milk, sugar, coconut, and vanilla extract in a large saucepan. Heat over medium-low
                heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and becomes a little darker. If you find that the
                cocada is cooking too quickly, reduce heat to low and continue stirring.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Once the mixture has thickened enough and feels heavy on the spoon, remove from heat and place spoonfuls
                on a piece of parchment paper.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Let cool for about 30 minutes (cocada will harden a bit) and transfer to a sealed container.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
