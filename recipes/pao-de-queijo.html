    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Brazilian cheese bread is very easy to make and features a chewy, cheesy, bready center encased in a beautiful,
        thin pastry crust.</p>
    <p>It is gluten-free, thanks to tapioca flour, which is also responsible for its unique texture.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>¼ cups tapioca flour, or more as needed</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>⅔ cup milk</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>½ cup mild olive oil</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>1 teaspoon kosher salt</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>2 large eggs, beaten</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>2 ounces freshly grated mozzarella cheese</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>2 ounces finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>1 pinch cayenne pepper</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Setps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Place tapioca flour in a mixing bowl; set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Combine milk, olive oil, and salt in a pan. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Immediately remove
                from
                heat and pour into tapioca in the bowl. Mix until a shaggy dough starts to form. Let rest for 5 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Add eggs, mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses, and cayenne to the bowl; stir with a fork until thoroughly
                combined. Use a medium ice cream scoop to portion dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Poke down any
                jagged
                bits using a wet finger if desired.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven until rolls are puffed and golden, about 20 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes
                and
                serve warm.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
